This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and TypeScript template, on the front-end. JSON-Server (document database and server) on the back-end, and the Concurrently NPM package to run both front-end and back-end servers at the same time on the `npm run server:all` command. Redux Toolkit is wonderful, it was developed by the maintainer of Redux himself. Happy coding! -Huy
